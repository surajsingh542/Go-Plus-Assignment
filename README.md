This project marks the completion of the assignment given by Go Plus Inc.

The assignment which was given by Go Plus Inc. was

Build a basic application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript that can perform the following operations:
=> List of all Users
=> Add a User
=> Edit & Update a User
=> Delete a User

The application form must have the following fields : Full Name, email, date of birth, gender, hobby, country, state, city. Note that country, state, city must a dependent dropdown (i.e., state dropdown must populate based on country field value and city dropdown must populate based on state field value) and proper field validations must be done.

=================================================================

In this project, the countries, state and cities data is not fetched from any external api as it wasn't mentioned to use any external api. So, instead I made the data to be static and the user data is being saved in local storage of the browser.
